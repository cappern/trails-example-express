:package: Express 4 Trailpack

This pack binds the routes compiled in [trailpack-router](https://github.com/trailsjs/trailpack-router)
to a [Express4 Server](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html). 

## Usage
Load in your trailpack config.

```js
// config/main.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  packs: [
    require('trailpack-core'),
    require('trailpack-router'),
    require('trailpack-express4')
  ]
}
```

## Static assets
```js
// config/main.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  paths: {
    ...
    www: path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'public')
    ...
  }
}
```

## View Config
Choose a template engine.

```js
// config/views.js
module.exports = {
  engine: 'jade'
}
```

Then simply write your views in a directory called 'views'!
